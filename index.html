      <p style="margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%; font-size: large; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif';">NOVA is an innovative multi- and inter-disciplinary Fellowship hosted by the University of Birmingham in the UK with the main aim to develop antimicrobial graphene oxide (GO)-lanthanide glasses (Ln)-hydroxyapatite (HA) composites for bone repair. Large bone defects and infections represent a major challenge for orthopaedic surgeons. Infections may be life threatening or, commonly, associated with long-term disability and pose a serious and increasing threat to public health, especially when antimicrobial resistance is becoming a serious problem. It is therefore highly desirable to develop novel multi-functional systems that can exhibit antimicrobial properties for bone repair. Lanthanide glasses (Ln) and Graphene Oxide (GO) have shown very interesting properties, the first being used in sensing and imaging as well as enabling cell attachment and isomorphic replacements for calcium, the second being an antimicrobial. NOVA will develop a multifunctional composite system combining the useful properties of a lanthanide host glass with the antimicrobial activity of Graphene Oxide and the bioactivity of Hydroxyapatite (HA). The proposed research is a novel research direction, and there is no previously published research on what is proposed to be a new class of multi-functional composites</span></p><br>

        <p style="font-size: larger;"><span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: larger">A review on the antimicrobial resistance estimated around 0.7M deaths worldwide each year with a possibility to rise to 10M a year by 2050.&nbsp; While resistance among many pathogens is soaring, the pipeline for new drugs is near-empty. In 2017, the World Health Organization reported that only eight antibiotics out of 51 that are currently in development will add value to the current arsenal of antibiotics. The challenge today is to improve and/or develop alternative materials for health care. Our work aims to develop antimicrobial lanthanide containing ceramic composites to address emerging bone and antimicrobial issues as well as diagnostic challenges such as bio-imaging applications taking advantage of the luminescence properties of these materials. In addition, lanthanide (Ln<sup>3+</sup>) ions can have the ability to modulate bone metabolism. Results support the argument that lanthanide-doped hydroxyapatite composites present enhanced osteoblastic cell response and antibacterial activity - the two key features contributing to an improved biological outcome for the next-generation bone grafts.</span></p>

      <p style="font-size: larger; margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;">Under Work Package (WP 1): Development and characterization of innovative lanthanide glasses and doped HA <br /><br />In this work package, the following tasks (Tasks 1.1-1.5) have been discussed in detail. Task 1.1 Preparation of Lanthanide glasses; Task 1.2 Bioactivity and dissolution studies; Task 1.3 Structural characterisation of Ln3+ glasses; Task 1.4 Hydroxyapatite doping and characterization; and Task 1.5 Photoluminescence studies of Lanthanide (Ln3+) glasses and doped HA. Under this tasks, Dr. Nandyala has been prepared and developed the following host glasses doped with different Lanthanides ions (0.5;1;2 and 4mol%). <br /><br />&bull; Silver-zinc borate host glasses doped with Gadolinium, Terbium and Dysprosium oxides &bull; Boro silicate host glasses doped with Europium oxide &bull; Boro silicate host glasses doped with Thulium oxide &bull; Boro tellurite silicate host glasses doped with Lanthanum and Samarium oxides &bull; Boro zinc silicate host glasses with Lanthanum and Samarium oxides <br /><br />Silver- Zinc Borate Host Glasses: Silver zinc borate glasses doped with Gadolinium, Terbium and Dysprosium oxides with a molar composition of {(6.4Ag2O-24ZnO-8Li2O-60B2O3) &ndash; 1.6(Ln2O3)} where Ln = Gd3+ Tb3+ &amp; Dy3+ were prepared by a melt quenching (in air) route at 1000&deg;C, using a porcelain crucible for an hour. The glasses produced were highly transparent with a good optical quality. The samples are abbreviated as GdG, TbG and DyG. Gas pycnometry is recognized as one of the most reliable techniques for obtaining absolute density measurements. Inert gas, such as helium is used as the displacement medium. Density calculations using the gas displacement method are much more accurate and reproducible than the traditional Archimedes water displacement method. The AccuPyc II 1340 Series Pycnometer was used to measure the densities of GdG, TbG and DyG glasses. The structural and physiochemical characteristics of GdG, TbG and DyG were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD). This was performed using a Siemens D 5000 diffractometer with Cu-K&alpha; radiation (&lambda;= 1.5418&Aring;). A DSC-404C NETZSCH was used for the thermal analysis of glasses. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Philips XL30 FEG ESEM) equipped with an energy dispersive analyser (EDS) (Oxford INCA) was used to evaluate the microstructure of the GdG , TbG and DyG glasses. Time-resolved measurements were performed using a HORIBA Scientific DeltaFlex equipped with a SpectraLED excitation source at 267 nm for GdG and 371 nm for the TbG glasses. Time-resolved emission spectra (TRES) were made by recording the time-resolved decay at equal wavelength steps for a fixed time period. Decay analysis of the TRES data to produce decay associated spectra (DAS) was performed using EzTime software by globally fitting the dataset. Steady state excitation-emission matrix (EEM) measurements were performed using a HORIBA Scientific FluoroLog 3 fluorimeter. These measurements involve scanning the emission for different excitation wavelengths (5 nm increments) and produce a &lsquo;contour map&rsquo; of intensity for this excitation &ndash; emission matrix. An amorphous nature was observed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and specimen data from the GdG sample is given in Figure 1. A DSC thermogram Figure 2 (a-c) showed the glass transition temperature (Tg) of GdG glass composition was calculated to be 489.5oC, whereas the Tg of TbG glass was at 494.5oC and similarly DyG glass was at 490.5oC. It seems that the glass transition temperature is in the same range. EDS analysis confirmed the presence of silver, zinc, dysprosium, gadolinium and terbium in the GdG, TbG and DyG samples. A specimen DyG glass sample as shown in Figure 3. The surface morphology of the DyG glass at magnification of 15000X was given in the SEM micrograph shown in Figure 4. The glass sample appeared as a homogeneous morphology. </p><br>
      <p style="font-size: larger; margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;">The emission spectra (Figure 7a) of DyG glass showed various emission bands when excited at 375nm, which are attributed to the transitions within the 4f shells of Dy3+ ion as 532 nm (6P7/2 &rarr;6F9/2), 552 nm (4F7/2 &rarr;6H9/2) and 571 nm (4F9/2 &rarr;6H13/2). The intensity of the most important emission band corresponding to the yellow colour centred at 571nm depended strongly on the concentration of the lanthanide ion and glass matrix environment. The sites and the environment experienced by the Dy3+ ions were not homogeneous in the glass resulting in an inhomogeneous broadening of the spectral features. Similarly, there was a lack of symmetry and homogeneous distribution of the luminescent centers will also have an impact on the time resolved decay kinetics. Figure 7b shows the lifetimes of the recorded three emission transitions of the DyG glass composition. The time-resolved decays from these emission bands; 532 nm (6P7/2 &rarr;6F9/2), 552 nm (4F7/2 &rarr;6H9/2), 571 nm (4F9/2 &rarr;6H13/2) gave average lifetimes of 0.096 ms, 0.108 ms and 0.162ms respectively. Among them, the transition (4F9/2 &rarr;6H13/2) has a long lifetime whereas the transition (4F7/2 &rarr;6H9/2) has a short lifetime about 0.096 ms. Furthermore, the dependence of the lifetimes on the intensity of emission transitions was observed in the DyG glass. A further insight can be obtained by measuring the time-resolved decay over a wavelength range at fixed wavelength increments for the same time period. This can give both decay and intensity information and can also be applied to structural studies. This technique is very sensitive to the kind of active ion, its local site and distribution within the host matrix. The determined luminescence decay associated spectra (DAS) of the DyG glass with excitation 375nm are shown in Figure 8. The DAS showed a bright yellow emission transition (4F7/2 &rarr;6H9/2), 571 nm which was consisted of different species, with different decay times at 0.062 ms, 0.148 ms, 0.337 ms and 0.701 ms. The yellow colour peak (4F7/2 &rarr;6H9/2) was very sharp at 0.337 ms and 0.701 ms, respectively. Also, it was noticed that, the trends of the peak were fully dependent on the decay times. The decay time of 0.062 ms showed a double peak with broadening and the decay time was gradually increased resulting in a very sharp yellow peak at 0.701 ms meaning that the distribution of luminescent centres had good impact on the decay times. Therefore, an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; lifetime of the DyG glass was observed as 0.701ms. Since the lifetimes of the DyG glass were in milliseconds, such glass could be labelled as yellow phosphorescent optical glass. This work shows that TbG and DyG glasses may useful in the green and yellow phosphorescent applications respectively. Further, optimization of the GdG glass is a good candidate for UV laser performance. </p>

      <p style="font-size: larger; margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;"><b>Figure 4:</b> A smooth surface morphology of DyG glass composition was observed by scanning electron microscopy at a magnification of 15000X. <br />Figure 5 shows contour plots of excitation wavelength (y-axis) against emission wavelength (x-axis). Red in the colour scale represents higher intensity and blue/black lower intensity. The upper diagonal line from the lower left to the upper right of the image, as seen in Figure 5a and b relates to Rayleigh scattering (i.e. emission wavelength equals excitation wavelength). There is another scattering feature present in the EEMs and this most likely pertains to Raman scattering. Although not covered in the EEM measurement complementary information, exciting further into the UV was obtained using the time-resolved measurements and the determination of decay associated spectra. Here, the UV band 310nm is clearly observed in the DAS in Figure 5c of GdG glass. The time-resolved determined decay associated spectra for GdG glass showed the presence of three lifetime components with lifetimes of 5.92, 20.3 and 53.1 &micro;s. In the spectrum of the 53.1&micro;s component the UVA peak at ~ 310nm from the 6P7/2 &rarr;8S7/2 transition was clearly observed. However, in the spectrum associated with a lifetime of 20.3 &micro;s, the peak wavelength was shifted towards 364-386nm. Similarly, the spectrum associated with a lifetime of 5.92 &micro;s exhibits a broad peak at around 360nm. As Gd3+ is only expected to emit radiation in the UV region the origin of the other peaks most likely relate to the host, as may the main emission in the EEMs, and requires further study. Of interest in Figure 6c is the lifetime related to 6P7/2 &rarr;8S7/2 transition. Therefore, the &ldquo;ideal or expected&rdquo; lifetime for this GdG glass is around 53.1 &micro;s, with which to monitor UVA radiation from the DAS profile. This also shows the power of using DAS to distinguish between emitting species. <br />For TbG glass, the EEM indicates that excitation close to 415nm provides the peak emission, in a similar fashion to that seen in the GdG sample. Again, this behaviour is tempting to ascribe to the host. However, exciting at shorter wavelengths or closer to 480nm produces emissions in the range of 489 nm, 545nm, 585nm and 620nm as observed in the Figure 5b. These transitions are assigned in the Figure 5d as follows; 5D4&rarr;7F6 (489nm), 5D4&rarr;7F5 (545nm), 5D4&rarr;7F4 (585 nm), 5D4&rarr;7F3 (620 nm) respectively. Of these peaks, the 545nm transition has been more prominent one with bright intensity compared to other peaks. Figure 6d gives the DAS and a featureless spectrum with an associated decay time of 189 &micro;s can be seen. This may emanate from the host and the advantage of using DAS can clearly be seen as the more typical spectral emission of Tb3+ is evident in the DAS with lifetimes of 1.3ms and 3.29ms. Thus, information concerning the transition energy and its decay kinetic can be obtained. Since the lifetime of the TbG is in milliseconds, such glasses could be labelled as green phosphorescent optical glasses. <br />The steady state excitation&ndash;emission matrix (EEM) measurements of DYG are shown in Figure 6a. The EEM indicates an emission at 571 nm for the DyG glass. Also, it is clear that there <br />11 <br />are other two underlying transitions in the range of 500-560 nm. The emission spectra were also taken directly from EEM profile as shown in Figure 9b, where the three transitions 532 nm, 552 nm and 571 nm could be observed, however the bands were overlapping in the spectra. This approach can give a reasonable idea of which wavelengths to use in the time-resolved experiments (especially DAS), which can enable a more in-depth investigation of the bands to be performed.</p>

  <p style="font-size: larger; margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;"><b>Figure 6:</b> (a) A contour map of excitation&ndash;emission matrix (EEM) and (b) Emission spectra collected by EEM data at excitation 375nm of DyG glass composition. <br />The emission spectra (Figure 7a) of DyG glass showed various emission bands when excited at 375nm, which are attributed to the transitions within the 4f shells of Dy3+ ion as 532 nm (6P7/2 →6F9/2), 552 nm (4F7/2 →6H9/2) and 571 nm (4F9/2 →6H13/2). The intensity of the most important emission band corresponding to the yellow colour centred at 571nm depended strongly on the concentration of the lanthanide ion and glass matrix environment. The sites and the environment experienced by the Dy3+ ions were not homogeneous in the glass resulting in an inhomogeneous broadening of the spectral features. Similarly, there was a lack of symmetry and homogeneous distribution of the luminescent centers will also have an impact on the time resolved decay kinetics. Figure 7b shows the lifetimes of the recorded three emission transitions of the DyG glass composition.  The time-resolved decays from these emission bands;  532 nm (6P7/2 →6F9/2), 552 nm (4F7/2 →6H9/2), 571 nm (4F9/2 →6H13/2) gave average lifetimes of 0.096 ms, 0.108 ms and 0.162ms respectively. Among them, the transition (4F9/2 →6H13/2) has a long lifetime whereas the transition (4F7/2 →6H9/2) has a short lifetime about 0.096 ms.  Furthermore, the dependence of the lifetimes on the intensity of emission transitions was observed in the DyG glass. A further insight can be obtained by measuring the time-resolved decay over a wavelength range at fixed wavelength increments for the same time period. This can give both decay and intensity information and can also be applied to structural studies. This technique is very sensitive to the kind of active ion, its local site and distribution within the host matrix. The determined luminescence decay associated spectra (DAS) of the DyG glass with excitation 375nm are shown in Figure 8. The DAS showed a bright yellow emission transition (4F7/2 →6H9/2), 571 nm which was consisted of different species, with different decay times at 0.062 ms, 0.148 ms, 0.337 ms and 0.701 ms. The yellow colour peak (4F7/2 →6H9/2) was very sharp at 0.337 ms and 0.701 ms, respectively. Also, it was noticed that, the trends of the peak were fully dependent on the decay times.  The decay time of 0.062 ms showed a double peak with broadening and the decay time was gradually increased resulting in a very sharp yellow peak at 0.701 ms meaning that the distribution of luminescent centres had good impact on the decay times. Therefore, an “ideal” lifetime of the DyG glass was observed as 0.701ms.  Since the lifetimes of the DyG glass were in milliseconds, such glass could be labelled as yellow phosphorescent optical glass. This work shows that TbG and DyG glasses may useful in the green and yellow phosphorescent applications respectively. Further, optimization of the GdG glass is a good candidate for UV laser performance. </p>
